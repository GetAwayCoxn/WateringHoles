# Watering Holes
Find your next favorite watering hole with this app!

## Code Platoon Final Project
This is my final personal project for the Code Platoon coding boot camp. It is a full stack web application that uses third party API's to help a user find and save breweries near their location or via search parameters. Django backend with user authentication and PostgreSQL for CRUD'ing and React.js frontend with Bootstrap for the user interface. Three weeks from start to live demo.

#### TO-DO's
- Improve U/I for user experience and engagement
- Re-work React state management for efficiency
- Update django models to add more user functionality (mostly thinking profile pages for now)
