# Watering Holes
Find your next favorite watering hole with this app. I am looking to make a small brewery location app with some social aspects such as likes/posts/etc.


### App Goals
- brewery finder/tracker
- location based
- display basic info
    - location/hours/contact
    - non alcohol options as well?
    - dog/kid friendly or not?
- display unique info
    - special beers/drinks
    - unique quirks/vibe
    - unique history of location/area?
- allow users to search/save/favorite/comment/etc

### Stretch Goals
- some type of rating system, maybe api driven
- search history for users
- user profile page
- display map of results and/or location

### Design Approach Considerations
- Back or Front end approach?
- Route handling?
- research premade bootstrap(or other) page design layouts
- Pages?
    - Home
    - Error
    - Login/Register
    - Search
    - Brewery Details
    - Profile (stretch)

### CRUDs
- logins
- favorites
- comments
- Search History (stretch)

### API Ideas
- google search api could work? (44min mark on video 1 from sierra platoon)
- read up on google maps/places api too, maybe harder but better results than the text search api
- news api for recent information on a location or area
- some kind of image/meme api for error landing page
- research non-recipe beer apis, shantys? random facts maybe?
